### *Proposal Document for Discord-like Communication Platform*

#### *1. Project Overview*
This project aims to develop a real-time communication platform similar to Discord, providing users with seamless voice, video, and text-based interactions. The application will feature authentication, user management, role-based permissions, and server-based communities. Users will be able to create and join groups (servers), participate in different channels, send direct messages, and engage in voice/video calls.

#### *2. Features and Functionalities*
- *User Authentication & Authorization*  
  - Email/Password authentication  
  - OAuth-based login (Google, GitHub, etc.)  
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA)  
  - Role-based access control  

- *Text Communication*  
  - Direct messaging  
  - Group chats  
  - Threaded conversations  
  - Rich text formatting (Markdown support)  
  - File and media sharing  

- *Voice & Video Communication*  
  - High-quality voice channels  
  - Video calls with screen sharing  
  - Push-to-talk functionality  
  - Noise suppression and echo cancellation  

- *Server & Channel Management*  
  - Create and manage servers  
  - Public and private channels  
  - Role-based access to channels  
  - Moderation tools (mute, kick, ban)  

- *Notifications & Presence System*  
  - Real-time online status (Online, Away, Do Not Disturb)  
  - Push notifications for messages and mentions  

- *Performance & Scalability*  
  - Optimized real-time message delivery  
  - Low-latency voice and video streaming  
  - Load balancing and distributed architecture
